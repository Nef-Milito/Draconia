*Cursed with monstrous features, Helstör was forsaken upon birth by its own flock. Survivong off the remains discarded by larger beasts, the rachitic hatchling was rescued on a icy winter night by Marauder Röhngard. The hunter's training awakened a singular voracity in the dragon, one that would never be satisfied. Following the hitman's death, Röhngard's body was the only one Helstör ever refused to devour.*

Helstör, the Ever-Hunger is a pitch black Bloodchaser with an emphasized thorny exterior. The regular Bloodchaser spines on its back through to its tail are massively increased in size, shrinking until near the tail tip, where two lines of inward-curved spines mark the end of the tail. Helstör's head features additional horns alongside its enlarged original ones, including a nose horn and a spike 'beard'. Additional spikes line the lower portion of its wings and along the elbow joint. Its wing membranes, eyes, and underside are deep red with flecks of scarlet.
