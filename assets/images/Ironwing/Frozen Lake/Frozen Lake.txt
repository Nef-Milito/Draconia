*Enigmatic in a way few Ironwings are, this clade attained kingdom-wide popularity when one of its kind pulled a drowning legionnaire’s son out of the icy waters of Hünavatn. Its silvery eyes seem to hold secrets deeper than the lakes of its home territory.*

Frozen Lake's visuals are very similar to Amber Fields in its patterns. It lacks the striping down its spine, though, and is generally a solid icey blue with a slightly lighter underside. Its wings feature a dark blue pattern that stretches into stripes from the front towards the back of the dragon, with large spots of lighter blue near the wing arm, identical in all but color to Amber Fields.
