*Seeing it fly through the skies on the winter solstice is said to predict years of peace. Charitable by nature, Olmund is depicted as the helper of lost souls. Adventurers on the brink of death recount being warmed up by tender flames and waking up the next morning on their doorstep, oblivious to the marvellous being that rescued them. Some fear that when Olmund dies concord and integrity will vanish in concert..*

Olmund, the Frost Howler is a primarily white Ironwing with scant red markings. Its face has a patch of red and all of spine portions of frills across its body are also red. Most notably, a celtic knot pattern covers the upper portion of each wing arm. In terms of shape, Olmund has much longer and more elegant horns than the average Ironwing. It also features a second pair of horns in place of the spike beard normal dragons have. The fins down its spine are greatly exaggerated and the frill ending its tail is much larger and shaped more like a fish's tail. Additionally, Olmund has a few fins trailing down its underside.
