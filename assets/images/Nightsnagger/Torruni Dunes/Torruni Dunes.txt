*What southerners commonly call "the North-Eastern desert" actually hosts of a mosaic of uncommon biomes. One of them, the plain of Torrrun, is enclosed by mountains high enough to prevent seaborne winds from carrying moisture to the land. Instead, dry currents from the east build up sandstorms in which this beast likes to hunt. A popular nursery rhyme depicts its behavior, referring to it as "The Dust Wraith".*

Torruni Dunes is a completely single-tone dragon in the shade of a light sandy tan. It has no markings to speak of. The only thing with color is its eye, which appears to be a more orange-brown color than the rest of its body.
