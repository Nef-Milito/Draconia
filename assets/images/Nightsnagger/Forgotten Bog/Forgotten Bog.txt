*For years, eastern shepherds debated over the continus disappearance of their cattle. Some blamed the weather while others suspected raiders. A few timidly hinted at the possible presence of ravenous dragons. The question was finally settled when shepherds themselves started to disappear.*

Forgotten Bog is a yellow dragon with black stripes along its spine that break off into smaller spots as they trail down the flanks. Its underside is a patternless pale yellow. The wings start the same yellow as the body, albeit slightly darker, but fade quickly into a dark block like the patterns on the rest of the creature.
