*The proudest of them all, Warelm shuns the gaze of the unworthy by soaring above the clouds, occasionally residing on a mountain's peak. Its frequent mood swings are known for degrading local weather conditions, creating thunderstorms that last for weeks. As a result, it is a farmland tradition to shout imprecations at Warelm during the dry season, in hopes of -literally- provoking rain.*

Warelm, Crest of the Storm is a black and gold colored dragon with very long, feather-shaped scales. These 'scaethers' are black and individually tipped with a golden edge, making Warelm's patterns appear busier the smaller its scales are, such as long its sides. Its underside are free from these scales and instead adorned with thin white plates.

It features a large frill that runs from its head down to the start of its neck, before restarting after the saddle as two individual sails. All are colored black, fading into gold towards the top. Its snout is gold, while its eye region is black and chin white. Its cheek are covered in the aforementioned scales.

Warelm has four long upward-curving horns that are colored white. Its wing arms are black while the wing membranes are gold and feature light striped patterning in a moderately darker color.
