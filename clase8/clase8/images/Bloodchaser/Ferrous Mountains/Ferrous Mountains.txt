*Bloodchasers have haunted the sleep of many on the continent, based on their reuptation for devouring entire villages and cruelly toying with their human victims. As any well-informed person will attest, this is untroe. For the Bloodchaser is too proud a beast to feed on such petty prey. A perfect progeny of its high-altitude domain, this specific individual is mostly suited for alpine hunting.*

Ferrous Mountains is the default Bloodchaser, determining the bodyshape for all others of its clade. Its primary scales are colored an ashy grey, transitioning into a maroon and then orange along the wing membranes. Its horns, spikes, and claws are all an ivory white coloration. The eyes are yellow. It features two large horns from the back of its skull, which are complemented by a crown of smaller horns and spikes lining the edge of the head and jawline. Additional small spikes jut from its wing elbow, a s well as two rows of sharp, but small, spikes down its back.
