*A common misconception among the continent’s populace is that all dragons dislike water. While this may be true as a rule of thumb, some of them have displayed remarkable adaptation to their environment. This clade’s hunting pattern includes burying its claws at the bottom of a fast stream and spreading its wings against the current as a way to collect plenty of fish for its meal.*

Raging River is a blue and white wyvern with stark contrast between the two colors. They meet approximately down the midline of the dragon, splitting it into two distinct halves. The face features far more white than blue, though the horns and spikes are all blue in color. The wings break this pattern with the introduction of some subtle red banding patterns across a white surface.
