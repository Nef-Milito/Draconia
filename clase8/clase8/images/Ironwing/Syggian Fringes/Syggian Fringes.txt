*The remoteness of the Syggian mountains has led to the preservation of the most peculiar customs. In one valley, an olden rite of passage prompts young natives to abduct hatchlings of this clade directly from their nests. While adult specimens can be seen showing their teeth and growling while chasing the kidnappers, they mostly find these inoffensive, terrorized bipeds quite amusing to play with.*

Syggian Fringes is white and brown Ironwing. The colors are merged together in a pattern reminiscent of cappuchinos and coffee art, or the swirling of paint. Its underside is a pink-tinged white and the edges of its wings are unmarked.
