*The Saark estuary is home to countless endemic species that have contributed to the Westernvald's notoriety as a haven for wildlife. This wary clade nests in the caves overlooking the inlet, shaltered from both the tides and unwanted guests. Windguards say these caverns hold the legendary tears of dragon-god Haervind, petrified in the form of dazzling aquamarine crystals.*

Haervan Caverns is a deep blue dragon with striking blue markings. The markings appear in spots across the body and more striated on the wings; in both places, they are so bright that they almost appear to glow in low light. The head of the dragon is a lighter purple-pink color and its eyes are a piercing blue.
