*While more than a thousand years have passed since the temple of Halgyn was first sacked, Venfir has remained faithful to its ancient undertaking as guardian of the scared grounds. Halgyn priests believe the deep sleep it was plunged in has considerably altered its faculties, and it is said to be able to communicate with the spirits who inhabit the gigantic, misty crypts that were built under the sanctuary.*

Venfir, the Lingering Dread is identical in model to Venfir, the Bristle Dread, being the same creature. Its colors are different, however, being a haunting green and black that alternate across the wyvern's body in stripes and dashes. Its horns and spines are also far darker and its eyes are a bright gold.
