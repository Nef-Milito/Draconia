*Many caves and mines have been infested by Nightsnaggers, as they favour places where the sunlight does not reach to lay their eggs. In order to deter eventual attacks, superstitious miners have carried many kinds of trinkets such as amulets or small bags filled with "dragon-repelling incense", bought from shady vendors. Their effectiveness remains to be proven.*

Fjaln√§rri Mines is a black wyvern with faint white stripes lining its spine, head, chest, and legs. The wing membranes fade slightly into a whiteish hue near the edges, as do the fins on its head. Spines and claws are also pure white. Most uniquely, the eyes of this dragon are a milky white with no pupils, lending it a ghostly dead-eyed look.
