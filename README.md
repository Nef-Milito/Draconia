# Draconia: Raise a real Dragon.

Hello!

This website is just a project for an online course I am doing. Needless to mention that Draconia is not a real company and that attempting to submit any formularies found within the website will not work.
Hope you like it!

Project is not finished. There are still some things left to do. Anything you find commented on the code means it is still being developed.

Cheers!
